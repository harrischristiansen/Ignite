I like to hang out with friends, play sports, and occasionally play games. I'm a fast learner and I think I can learn a lot from Ignite.","I want to be a part of Ignite because programming for school and doing it myself, it has limits. It would make our lives much easier if we could learn from our seniors who were most recently in our same shoes. It would be a good opportunity to talk to people that are more experienced than us to help us. I plan to learn specific, hands-on application that we don't go in depth from the school courses in order to improve myself.","It hasn't been long(2 years) since I started programming, but I have programmed using Objective-C, C++, and Java. I just know their syntax and how to use the languages in simple context. I've done some work with Maven Dependencies in Korea, but I'm not an expert with it(I just know it works).",10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,10am-11am,
8/25/2015 2:01:24,Dhruv Upadhyay,1997dhruv@gmail.com,"My name's Dhruv, and I'm from the small town of Crossville, Tennessee. I moved to Crossville from Toronto, Canada in 2008.  My hobbies include watching movies/tv, reading, surfing the Internet, hanging out with friends, working out, and playing basketball. My favorite types of movies include comedies, action and adventure, fantasy, and sci-fi.  I love listening to music; my favorite genres happen to be Pop, R&B, and Hip-Hop. I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science. I have no background in CS really because choosing this subject was sort of a intuitive decision; however, I have a strong will to learn as much as I can in this subject. Because my school never offered any CS related courses, I always saw myself at a disadvantage when comparing myself to other students going into CS who have tons of programming experience and such. But instead of feeling intimated by the other students, I saw this a challenge to try to catch up to their experience and knowledge. So, during the summer of 2015 (once I was done with traveling), I dedicated the month before college to teach myself basic programming. I started to use Codecademy to learn Javascript. After a few Javascript lessons, I had fallen in love with learning and writing code. Soon, I completed Javascript and moved onto HTML and CSS - this is where it got really fun.  After I learned some basic HTML and CSS, I began to build a VERY basic webpage just for fun. Even though it was extremely simple, knowing that I built the webpage from scratch by writing code was the best feeling ever.  If I had to describe how I felt that time in one word, it would be “awesome.”  Just the feeling to be able to make something out of nothing, as well as to know something that none of my friends knew how to do gave me the feeling of awesomeness. After dabbling with some HTML and CSS, I decided that it was time that I learned another language. Due to its popularity, I chose Java to learn next. I used a course on Udemy to teach me core Java. It was difficult at first, but the feeling of accomplishment I received when I learned something new or understood a concept was just amazing.  During my time at Purdue, I’ve made it my goal to expatiate my knowledge in  programming as well as Computer Science itself. By doing so, I believe that I will not only be able to be the find success in terms of my career path, but I will also be able to help other CS majors with little to no experience find success in their lives and accomplish their goals.","By being a part of Ignite, I will be able to make the most of my abilities, which will ultimately allow me to be a successful CS student. I believe that the idea of mentorship is a great concept because it allows for what is not available in lecture halls with 250+ people, and that's working one on one with experts in the field. By being a part of Ignite, I will benefit from gaining experience in the different areas of CS outside of class, BUT I will also be able to learn the teaching methods used in this program so that I may help others in the same manner.  Also, I would like to add that while learning is my main goal to join Ignite, I also plan on having a great time and enjoying what I do in this program. ","I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, and Core Java in 30 days. In August, I started iOS development using Swift 2 and xCode 7 using a Udemy course. So far in the course, I've made 3-4 simple apps such as calculating a cat's age in cat years, telling the user whether a number is prime or not, and a guessing game that generates a random number. Future iOS apps include more advanced apps such as Flappy Bird clone, Snapchat clone, Tinder clone, Instagram clone, uber clone (probably have them done in the next month or so).

However, success for me has always meant something more than just being a straight-A student. For me, success means being happy and peaceful in life while knowing that your skills are making a positive impact on the life of others. And to be successful, we must explore the boundaries of how far we can stretch our skill sets.

At a young age of 16, I landed an internship with Linguavista, a language services company based in Bengaluru, India. I learnt during my time at Linguavista about the underlying importance of the translation industry in delivery the source messages in one language and delivering it accurately in another language. I developed a keen interest in linguistics and slowly I felt drawn toward the idea of exploring the domain of human-like translation through artificial intelligence. Popular tools like Google Translate are far less than perfect and technologies such as IBM Watson are still very much in the development phase as far as translation goes. I spend my time learning about language procession through artificial intelligence and hope that one day, I am able to develop a language processor which is powered by artificial intelligence. I hope that in the years to come, I will get opportunities to get involved with the Artificial Intelligence team at Purdue and continue to learn more about this beautiful field.

It is a new beginning at Purdue University for me. It's a great campus to be in and I can continue with my hobbies of photography, biking and of course learning to code.

Not because of the skill level of classes, I was fine there. What really made me realize I needed more diversity was the fact that I went to 3 hackathons, and only made a project for one of them, where I only did a few things such as small algorithms and designing backgrounds for our apps. I wasn't able to complete each project due to lack of ideas, I was simply hindered by lack of group participation and lack of knowledge needed to make my ideas possible. At that point, I knew that I needed to diversify my knowledge in computer science. 

I am fluent in Java, C, and C#. My main incorporation with coding outside of classes is the SIGGD section of Purdue's ACM. In that group, I am the vice president, and our main goal is to create a new game each semester, practicing game development skills and needing new recruits from all aspects, including programming, art, level design, and sound technology. Outside of that group, I have not got much of a grasp with any other programming-based extra-curricular activities. ","Ignite sounds like a great way to *ignite* my career in ways that normal ways couldn't.

Living in a small town, there was a natural tendency for people to fall into two major and dominant categories: sports or video games.

I excelled in sports, receiving ""Most Improved Wrestler"", ""All Conference Center (Football)"", and ""Most Valuable Varsity Offensive Linemen"", just to name a few.  Beyond athletics, I also found myself engaged in technological activities.  My primary group of friends, all of which fall into the ""video games"" category, decided to build our own computers so that we could game together.  This truly inspired my jumping into computers and technology; learning about all of the hardware, how they work, what is compatible with what, etc.  My love of technology got me an internship at my high school with the tech department, who later hired me for a paid position over the summer prior to coming to Purdue.","I want to be a part of Ignite because I truly believe that if you want to succeed in your field, you need to surround yourself with people who are also striving to succeed and who have optimism, passion, and expertise.

Up to this point I've wanted to start on my own coding project outside of school, but I can't seem to get the time set aside. I'm hoping that Ignite will give me a little push in the right direction with how to start your own project, and maybe how to get your project out in the world after you're done with it. I have a mid-range level of experience with coding in java, but I've never actually uploaded anything to the internet, or posted an app anywhere.

I don't know what I want to do with my degree yet, but I picked Purdue's program because I feel that I can go into any industry that I want with such a growing need for people with computer skills. In High school you could find me playing the trumpet in the Fort Wayne youth symphony, my school's jazz band and various other ensembles.","I want to be a part of Ignite because I want to work on a substantial project to put my coding skills to the test. I have done various online classes and programming tutor sites, but I never know where to begin making any sort of project or idea that I have. 

One of the skills that I'm interested in is making Android applications because I have experimented with Android Studio and the SDK but have never really learned the details of how all the systems work together. I use an android phone every day and making something for this seems like a very tangible way to learn. I would also like to learn how to contribute to open source projects. I've been fascinated with open source software for a while and I admire how a community of people can collectively make software of high quality without being solely motivated by profit. I'm really interested in the fields of AI and machine learning because I believe that these innovations could have a major impact on our daily lives within the next few decades. The notion of super-intelligence and computers that can constantly improve themselves seems like a science fiction movie coming to life. 

I would also welcome an opportunity to have a mentor because it would help me meet more people from my school that are like minded and show me what I specifically can improve at.

wish to combine my mathematical, physical and programming skills.","Programming, I believe, is making something out of nothing. The first programming language that I learnt was logo; I made many related projects in it. One was about countries that I have visited, namely, India, Netherlands and France. I wrote about their landmarks, added pictures and videos, and made some interesting tests. The second project was about the Universe; I created some good graphics. It had information about the planets in our solar system, small celestial bodies, types of galaxies and constellations. There was also game with some tasks such as to find the Pole Star and put it in the right constellation and arrange the planets according to their names. After logo, I studied Pascal, in which I mostly wrote programs to solve mathematical and physical problems. I still use this language to write code in programming Olympiads sometimes. Now I am learning C and C++. I have used these to make a calculator which does mathematical operations with long integers, solves equations and counts determinant of a matrix.

Being the vice president of my school's chess club, I attended many inter-school chess tournaments.  My favorite sport is Tennis.  Looking back, I never thought I would be able to make it to my varsity Tennis team (although being the reserve player most of the time does suck =/ ).  I also played trombone in my school's band.  This made me a very passionate classical music fan, especially the Romantic Era music.  I can talk for days about my favorite composer, Gustav Mahler!","It is my goal to get a good software engineering internship in the summer between my sophomore year and junior year.  I believe that Ignite program will be able to assist me to make good decisions in my professional development career.  The mentors can definitely help me with following:
1)  Helping me form ideas for a programming personal projects.  I have seen many other people's projects online, yet I seem to lack idea for one.
2)  Giving me tips on how to be successful with Purdue CS courses and beyond.  For example, how does one organize time most efficiently to handle the workload at Purdue?
3)  Directing me to a correct path.  How do I look for good jobs?  What is the best way to prepare for notoriously technical interviews?  
4)  Training me to be a better programmer.  What are good habits that I should pick up?  How do I keep my codes clean and understandable to other programmers? How do I be a good team member/leader?

I have all my life multi-tasked and have tried to gain experience from anything and everything. I've won several best all rounder awards in school for my participation in practically everything. I've been an A grader through out my school life and have also been the state captain of my Badminton state team for the past 7 years. I've always been ranked in top 20 in India. I also have a lot of leadership experience as in school, I was also the House Captain of my House and we ended up winning the overall trophy. I was also awarded the Best House captain trophy. Apart from all this, I am a motivated individual who is always looking for new opportunities to learn and gain knowledge. One thing i love the most, (after food), is Computers. I can spend hours on this wonderful machine trying to build something or understanding how stuff works. I had decided long back in class 5th that whatever I do in life, it'll basically revolve around computers. ","Ignite is the best thing that could have come up. The university curriculum is not enough to gain true knowledge of CS. We need to have that extra edge and tricks up our sleeves to be different from the rest, and Ignite exactly does that. Collaborating with Seniors with such great Experience in this field is what I always wanted. They will show us the path to move and teach us things that really matter. I look forward to the resources and other materials I'll get to increase my knowledge of computers. I hope to come out of this program as a person with the real required knowledge of computers and also hope to open my mind to ideas i could never maybe think of. It many times takes external force to truly ""ignite"" the mind.",I've done 2 years of Python and also know the basics of SQL.

I was on the Golf and Tennis team for my high school as the Varsity Team Captain from 2014-2015. I was an active member of my Key Club and also was the President of my high school's chapter of the National Honor Society. I was the captain of the Science team for my high school's academic team that competed in the state championship at Purdue University where we finished 3rd in the state; similarly, I was on the Interdisciplinary team for my school that finished State Runner's Up. I am very communication oriented and can efficiently work in a team and relay ideas.","I hope to be able to be a more efficient programmer and be able to see specifically what the problem is, how to approach it and to be able to write the code to create a solution. I also think that it is a good experience to get involved with and that it would be a good supplement to CS classes. If I enjoy Ignite, I would probably try to be a sponsor in the future. Because of my little experience in programming and the absence of any computer science course/oriented club at my high school, I'm hoping Ignite can help me with learning to code.","Brand new to coding in anything other than RobotC. I was the programmer for my high school's VEX Robotics team which was enough experience to advance our team to the World Championships in 2013 and 2015.

My favorite project to date is my custom driver's station for my FIRST robotics team. The driver's station is essentially a large control board that holds a laptop and has buttons and switches to perform robot functions. This is theoretically not a hard thing to build, but I saw a problem with many teams' driver's stations (including our own). These stations needed to be rebuilt every year to comply with the yearly game and its unique features. 

I took it upon myself to design a fully modular and easily modifiable driver's station that would serve my team for years to come. What I ended up with was a large, beautiful contraption of CNC cut acrylic featuring modular buttons, switches, displays, and encoders, that could simply be moved around and switched out from year to year to fit the new game. The whole station has an Arduino Mega running the Megajoy firmware at it core and will serve my team for years. 

My driver's station project was perhaps my largest, but no matter how small,  all of my projects have taught me that I love to hack.  One project led to another, and today I have thoroughly explored the hacking realm with my various endeavors.  ","While I may have adamantly praised the scope of my hacking experience in the previous question, I definitely realize a hole in what I would like to know.

Having lived in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and U.S has given me a wide berth of culture to draw upon. It gave me the ability to adapt to a diverse range of environments, and learn about different ways of doing things. I grew up in an environment that fired my passion for computer science particularly since my dad and sister majored in Computer Science which motivated me to try it out especially since I have a passion for developing new things.  It was when I started experimenting with coding that I began to develop a love for it. Programming gives me an infinite amount of possibilities for innovation. I believe nothing is impossible with computers and imagination. In addition to computer programming I have been playing tennis since I was five years old.  Tennis taught me many lessons and the most important one is that not to fear mistakes and instead learn from them. This made me not want to give up when I compiled errors in coding and taught me how to overcome those errors in order not to repeat them again.","I want to be a part of Ignite so I can work with a mentor on one of the projects I have in mind. I have been here for two weeks and I still get lost going to my classes. I've asked around and I'm not the only one. Even sophomores still get lost around campus because there are a lot of buildings that look similar. I've tried to use the Purdue map application and yet I still get lost. The Purdue map doesn't have arrows that shows the direction like google map. Instead I thought how useful it would be if the phone would project arrows on the floor to direct the user to desired destination. This could be an android application program that contains Purdue's campus map. I would hope to learn how to create android applications that will help students around here, and help people around the world in the future. 
"," I took an AP Computer Science course in high school, which was Object Oriented Programming in Java. For one of my projects, I designed a skiing game in which I relied on GUI, Buffer, and Threads to create. I developed a character that would ski downhill. In this game the player’s main objective was to not hit any of the tree through using keyboard controls that manipulated the character to avoid any obstacles. I also took an HTML course and created a webpage by using HTML. The summer of my junior year I had an NSLC camp where I created an undersea robot using programming language.

I have lived my entire life in Lagos, Nigeria where the use of technology is very basic and now that I am attending Purdue, I plan to take full advantage of my Computer Science program and the overall environment to benefit my home country. Apart from things technology related, I am a very social person, I love to learn about new cultures whenever I get the chance to. I love learning new things and overall just being active within my environment. Another thing that I consider very important about myself is that when I set my mind to accomplishing something, I make sure that I not only complete that thing but do it to my best ability.My motto is to always work double the amount the time that you play.","My country as of now, is about 30 years behind and is just entering the Identification Age where we are just starting to identify people on databases.

Personality-wise, I would describe myself as motivated, ambitious, and someone who strives to be unique and different from the crowd. I absolutely love trying new things (the more random, the better) and exploring the world around me. That includes wandering around the underground tunnels and buildings here at Purdue--I love anything that resembles a maze....though I do occasionally get confused looks from grad students who are actually supposed to be in those buildings. I'm also the type of person that chooses ""dare"" 95% of the time when playing ""truth or dare"". As to more specific interests (outside of school), I obsess over my favorite TV shows--Doctor Who, Sherlock, and the Big Bang Theory. A favorite hobby of mine is dancing--I've been dancing for 10 years with experience in competition and I'm hoping to continue dancing throughout college. I've always been sort of gravitating towards tech and engineering fields as I've done tech-related summer camps every summer in high school, and I volunteered explaining exhibits at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose for two years, which was a fantastic experience.

As a child, I was always fascinated by technology. When I received a remote control car for my tenth birthday, I spent a whole day taking it apart and examining the pieces. I didn’t know what most of the parts did, but that only added to my fascination. Since then, I’ve grown from taking things apart to building things. In high school, I signed up for a few computer science courses and was able to funnel my enthusiasm for technology into coding. 
Five adjectives that best describe me are curious, persistent, self-motivated, competitive, and reflective. I am always seeking to learn new things about computer science and apply them in projects.","I want to be part of Ignite because I would love to create a cool project with the guidance of an mentor. Writing code alone is difficult; large projects seem daunting and overwhelming when I try to tackle them by myself. With Ignite, I hope to build a project with the help of someone who is more experienced and can provide specific, one-on-one feedback and advice. Ignite is the perfect opportunity for me to transform a cool idea into a real product.","I have three years of programming experience in Java and am familiar with C++ and Javascript. I took three programming courses in high school: Introduction to Programming (C++), Introduction to Virtual Reality, and AP Computer Science (Java).

I’ve also used the Bootstrap framework to design a few interactive websites, including the homepage for my high school coding club. During the summer, I interned at the Air Force Research Laboratory Discovery Lab and worked on Project AVATAR, a software program that features an interactive virtual map and allows simple visualization of media in a virtual environment.

I found Codecademy and learned front-end development; to say I was blown away would be an understatement. As an inherently artistic person who couldn't draw or paint, web design became an artistic outlet, and it drew me deep into the world I was oblivious to. Since then, I've become well abled in web development (both front and back-ends), and have taken a keen interest in exploring different paradigms such as functional programming. My passion has since drifted from design and front-end and I am now focused on studying more theoretical concepts, although I do still love developing applications. You can visit my website at http://www.sachanganesh.com/ to see some of my endeavors.","Throughout high school, I always believed I needed an apprenticeship to help me achieve things that were, at the time, elusive and hard to reach. I thought that having someone to hold your hand through difficult concepts and applications would enable me to perform better. However, when I mentored underclassmen in basic CS and even web development, I found something else; I wanted someone to depend on to help me excel, which was very much unlike how I wanted to conduct myself. Now, with the knowledge that an apprenticeship is not necessary to heighten my own skills, I realize that Ignite offers a more nuanced program. It offers support in the form of instruction when in need, and a bridge to a world of connections and knowledge. I hope that through Ignite, I will be given a leg up to becoming a better software engineer by improving the way I code, pair programmer to get comfortable with coding projects in collaboration (even in concept and not code), and an experienced developer with many skills and assets.

Living life always knowing that the place I am and the people I'm with are only temporary has lead me to having a unique perspective in my life.

Thus, it was perhaps inevitable that I would end up with a few quirks. Chief amoung, growing up, I always had a strange fascination with efficiency.  I always tried to always find the most efficient way to solve a problem, to the point where I remember driving my parents insane by spending more time figuring out the optimal way to finish my homework than actually working on it.  What attracted me, a person who had no programming experience before coming to Purdue, to computer science was the unparalleled freedom that computer programming afforded me, allowing me to pursue the perfectly optimized solution in whatever way I wished. Another trait that I developed growing up is keeping an open mind. I come a culture of encouraging diversity. Whenever people in my community find out that I’m Chinese, they are curious without being rude, and I never feel like my heritage affects other people’s opinion of me, a basic courtesy that I strive to give to everyone I meet. Additionally, an open-mind means being willing to consider other perspectives. Growing up, I had the fortune to be friends with a wide variety of extraordinary individuals, from Amber, a environmentalist feminist, to John-Nick, a Filipino gay man. They taught me to educate myself about an issue and examine it through other perspectives before making any judgments, a lesson I treasure to this day. Keeping an open mind matters to me because without it, I would not be the multifaceted person I am today, a juxtaposition of my Chinese heritage, the Western culture I grew up in, and all the cultures of my friends in between.","The Chinese have a proverb: ""One generation plants the trees, and another gets the shade."" Growing up, my grandfather lived in fear, dodging Japanese patrols and watching his siblings die one by one. After the war ended, he lived on government rations and had no running water. Despite these horrible conditions, my grandfather managed to secure a job as a mechanical engineer and claw his way out of poverty to provide for my mother. Similarly, in order to give my brother and me better opportunities in life, my parents moved to the US, giving up everything--their jobs, their families,  and their middle-class status. They arrived speaking no English, with nothing but two suitcases and $200 in cash. Yet, by the time I entered school, my parents managed to secure a solid income that could support a middle-class American lifestyle for my brother and me. I could not be the person I am today without the shoulders of my ancestors upon which I stand. My grandparents and parents are my teachers and mentors, the trees that provide the shade, the privileges, lifestyle, and moral guidance I too often take for granted. I want to be a part of IGNITE because I want to gain the skills and expertise so that one day, I too can help promising new students flourish. I want to be a part of IGNITE because I want to follow in the footsteps of my ancestors and leave behind a legacy that will remain long after I have been forgotten. I want to be a part of IGNITE because I want to help plant the tree under which future generations flourish.","My programming experience is very novice level. We had no programming classes at my high school, and I never quite found the time to seriously study programming on my own.

9/2/2015 0:22:25,Weiyi Zhou,weiyi.zhou1514@gmail.com,"I come from Portland, from “Keep Portland Weird” and the celebration of all things weird and quirky. Thus, it was perhaps inevitable that I would end up with a few quirks. Chief amoung, growing up, I always had a strange fascination with efficiency.  I always tried to always find the most efficient way to solve a problem, to the point where I remember driving my parents insane by spending more time figuring out the optimal way to finish my homework than actually working on it.  What attracted me, a person who had no programming experience before coming to Purdue, to computer science was the unparalleled freedom that computer programming afforded me, allowing me to pursue the perfectly optimized solution in whatever way I wished. Another trait that I developed growing up is keeping an open mind. I come a culture of encouraging diversity. Whenever people in my community find out that I’m Chinese, they are curious without being rude, and I never feel like my heritage affects other people’s opinion of me, a basic courtesy that I strive to give to everyone I meet. Additionally, an open-mind means being willing to consider other perspectives. Growing up, I had the fortune to be friends with a wide variety of extraordinary individuals, from Amber, a environmentalist feminist, to John-Nick, a Filipino gay man. They taught me to educate myself about an issue and examine it through other perspectives before making any judgments, a lesson I treasure to this day. Keeping an open mind matters to me because without it, I would not be the multifaceted person I am today, a juxtaposition of my Chinese heritage, the Western culture I grew up in, and all the cultures of my friends in between.","The Chinese have a proverb: ""One generation plants the trees, and another gets the shade."" Growing up, my grandfather lived in fear, dodging Japanese patrols and watching his siblings die one by one. After the war ended, he lived on government rations and had no running water. Despite these horrible conditions, my grandfather managed to secure a job as a mechanical engineer and claw his way out of poverty to provide for my mother. Similarly, in order to give my brother and me better opportunities in life, my parents moved to the US, giving up everything--their jobs, their families,  and their middle-class status. They arrived speaking no English, with nothing but two suitcases and $200 in cash. Yet, by the time I entered school, my parents managed to secure a solid income that could support a middle-class American lifestyle for my brother and me. I could not be the person I am today without the shoulders of my ancestors upon which I stand. My grandparents and parents are my teachers and mentors, the trees that provide the shade, the privileges, lifestyle, and moral guidance I too often take for granted. I want to be a part of IGNITE because I want to gain the skills and expertise so that one day, I too can help promising new students flourish. I want to be a part of IGNITE because I want to follow in the footsteps of my ancestors and leave behind a legacy that will remain long after I have been forgotten. I want to be a part of IGNITE because I want to help plant the tree under which future generations flourish.","My programming experience is very novice level. We had no programming classes at my high school, and I never quite found the time to seriously study programming on my own. However, I did attend the CS BRIDGE program over the summer; thus, I do possess a basic level of Java proficiency.

I would like to seek advice from others that have taken the class. Ignite is the perfect way to get involved on campus as well as help me to succeed in my major and in my career.","I have taught myself basic coding through java. I have worked with programs like CAD, scratch, and LEGO robotics. I do not have much programming experience, but I feel as though that puts me at an advantage rather than a disadvantage because I have more room to learn and a better foundation than others.

I find programming to be fun but at times quite frustrating especially when you are unsure what to do.","I want to be part of Ignite as I would like to go beyond academics. After a year in Computer Science I still feel quite unsure in doing side projects/products as I don't know how to start them or what is a good idea.
I hope to learn how to be a more proactive programmer from the experts at Ignite.","The only programming I have done so far as are the projects assigned to me by CS classes(Java,C,C++).

9/2/2015 12:42:36,Brendan Raftery,braftery@purdue.edu,"My name is Brendan Raftery and I am a Freshman in the Computer Science program here at the wonderful Purdue. I grew up in Edwardsville,  Illinois, a town about 15 minutes east and over the river from St. Louis. I have a twin brother, Shaun, who is going to the University of Illinois and is pursuing a pre-medical degree.

I took AP Computer Science in high school along with some Java, Web Design, Microsoft Products, and other computer related courses. I originally was going to go into the medical field like my brother and parents, (who are both pharmacists), but after going through a job shadowing program through my school, I decided that the medical field is not the place for me. People there are not happy to be there, sure they might be making a lot of money, but I want to LOVE what I do for a living. So I am now pursuing Computer Science and Purdue is the school I fell in love with to do it at. So I hope I can give it back as much as it will provide me.

So far I have gotten involved with my classes, along with co-founding a new group on campus called the Independent Game Developers Club (IGDC). We began forming last semester (I wasn't here yet but I was helping) and I took up the officer position as Webmaster, so since then I have made the website for the club, a 6x2 ft vinyl banner for the club, I designed and printed hundreds of flyers and posters, and I have ran multiple promotional fairs including the b-involved fair and the activities bonanza. It has been great so far talking to all of the people who are interested in game design like I am and seeing our club grow. I'm now working on our Callout Presentation, Personal Projects, and I am learning a game engine ""Gamemaker Studio"" so I can mentor club members who want to learn that engine.","I want to push myself and I feel that ignite will help me do that. One of the things Purdue sold me on was the plentiful internship opportunities and events such as hackathons. I feel Ignite will help get me even more involved in the Purdue community and help me network and meet great new people. I am new here and I don't necessarily know where to begin when it comes to internships and events like Boilermake and Hack the Anvil. I have only done game jams before along with some programming competitions for school.

I also want to experience different parts of the tech field so my knowledge of technology can be more colorful and not as focused on just CS and Game design.","I have taken AP computer science A in highschool along with a Java course prior to it. We programmed in Java and used Eclipse and Textpad. I also took a Web Design class and used Dreamweaver, but I didn't learn too much from the class and would like to relearn it. I also took a ""Special Topics"" class my last semester which was a free roaming class in the technology field. We were forced to do a few projects, I did research and some stuff in JavaScript and then some more Java in Robocode. Near the end of the year we got to create our own project, for which I designed a text-based adventure game in Java and made it so that it not only worked, but was customizable for anyone who wished to make their own game with it. I also have experience in GameMaker Studio, a game development software which uses a custom scripting/coding language and I am mentoring it for the IGDC",,,,,7pm-8pm,,7pm-8pm,7pm-8pm,7pm-8pm,7pm-8pm,
9/2/2015 18:55:07,Tomasz Parzadka,tparzadk@purdue.edu,"Over the 2014-2015 school year, I was fortunate to be a part of a fundraising gourp called Cross Countries. This group was on a mission to raise money to help finish the construction of Bethel Hospital in Bolivia. The group ended up raising $60,000 dollars and was sent on missionary trip to Bolivia from Oak Lawn. It was a life changing experience to say the least. Over the course of the two weeks we spent in Bolivia much of the time was in the hospital. Each day we would continue our progress on finishing the hospital. I didn't seem to miss my computer and viewed myself adaptable to different settings. I believe this is an important trait to have as it may affect the way someone works in a group setting.","I want to be a part of Ignite because it would give me an insider on what coding in a real-life setting is like. I hope to meet new people that enjoy coding as much as I do and more. Getting experience from events like Ignite is what many programmers need and exposes them to the real world rather than just a classroom or lab. I hope to learn new coding techniques, a stronger work ethic, and working in a group.","I took a Python class in high school and did some coding on the side over the summer. After my missionary trip in Bolivia, I took part in a Computer Science Bridge Program with Purdue University. We went through most of the Java semester in two weeks.
